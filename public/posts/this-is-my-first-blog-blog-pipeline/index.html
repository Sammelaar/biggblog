<meta name="description" content="The goal

To build a blog about cool things that are passing by in my life. Such things as tech or gadgets I bought/used.


How does this blog works?
My blog is build with the following tools/products:

Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking tool that focuses on building a personal knowledge base using Markdown files. It allows users to create a network of interconnected notes through links and tags, making it easy to organize and retrieve information. \n Go download it yourself! https://obsidian.md/


Hugo

Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator designed for building websites. It uses templates and markdown files to create content, making it easy to structure and organize. With its lightning-fast build times, Hugo is particularly well-suited for developers and content creators who need to generate static sites quickly and efficiently. \n Go download it yourself! https://gohugo.io


Custom scripts

By custom scripts the local markdown files from Obsidian will be copied to the local Hugo-site.


GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, primarily used by developers to manage and share code. It leverages Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to code over time, enabling multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. \n Go use it yourself! https://github.com


TransIP-hosting

TransIP is a Dutch hosting provider offering a wide range of web hosting services, including domain registration, cloud hosting, virtual private servers (VPS), and dedicated servers. Known for its reliable infrastructure and high-performance servers, TransIP allows users to easily manage their websites and online projects through an intuitive control panel.



So, how do you build this?
Obsidian

First we start creating a folder called posts in Obsidian where you can store all your blogposts.
