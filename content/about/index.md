Hi there! :wave: I’m **Sam van den Biggelaar**, a 28-year-old tech enthusiast and project manager from the Netherlands. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by computers and technology, and that passion has stayed with me throughout my life. :man_technologist:

Professionally, I work as a Project Manager for a Managed Service Provider (MSP), where I combine my love for tech with strategic planning and team coordination to deliver efficient IT solutions.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about :soccer:, :earth_africa:, and, unsurprisingly, all things around :computer: . Whether it’s staying active, exploring new places, or discovering the latest innovations, I’m always eager to learn and grow.

Let’s connect and share ideas about technology! :rocket::star:
